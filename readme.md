## PROBLEM
Applying to job posts on linkedin everyday is a tedious exercise. It takes time and its just boring. 


## SOLUTION
As a python developer skilled in building bots, I created a bot to automate this whole process of applying to job posts for me. The bot takes in the link for the preferred job search and then it loops through them, look for the ones with easy applys and then apply automatically. 

## DISCLAIMER
A quick disclaimer here, this wasn't built to spam a company's job post listing or to be used in illegal manner. Use this bot at your own risk. Linkedin may or may not block you should you use this irresponsibly. 

I made this public and thus anyone could build on this.
