**This project uses Selenium and the time module**

## PROBLEM
Applying to job posts on linkedin everyday is a tedious exercise. It takes time and its just boring. 


## SOLUTION
As a python developer skilled in building bots, I created a bot to automate this whole process of applying to job posts for me. The bot takes in the link for the preferred job search and then it loops through them, look for the ones with easy applys and then apply automatically.
